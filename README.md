# My notes on learning git

Git is probably the most used [version control
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) on the
planet. Unfortunately it is rather complicated. This repository
contains my notes (in Dutch) on my git journey. My plan for learning
git is reading some articles and possibly a book:

1. [Software Carpentry Project - Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
1. [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html) (Maybe)
1. [Git from the inside out](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out)
1. [Git from the bottom up](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/)
1. [A git primer](https://danielmiessler.com/study/git/)
1. [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
